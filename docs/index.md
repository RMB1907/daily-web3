# ðŸ“˜ Concept of the Day: NFTs â€“ Non-Fungible Tokens

## ðŸ§© ELI5 Allegory  
Imagine you own a rare trading card. There is only one like it in the world. Even if others take pictures or make copies, everyone knows yours is the original. An NFT works in the same way on the internet. It is a digital certificate of ownership for a unique item, recorded permanently on a blockchain.

## ðŸ“– Standard Definition  
Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that represent ownership of specific items or content using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, which are fungible and interchangeable, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each one is distinct and not exchangeable on a one-to-one basis.

NFTs are commonly used to represent digital art, music, virtual land, game items, and collectibles. They are created using blockchain standards that ensure each token is verifiably unique and traceable.
