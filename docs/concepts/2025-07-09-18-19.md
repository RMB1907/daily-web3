### ðŸ“˜ Concept: Ipfs

#### ðŸ§© ELI5 Allegory:
Imagine you're at a library, and you want to lend a book to a friend who lives on the other side of the city. Traditional libraries would require you to physically hand over the book, which can be inconvenient and unreliable. With IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), it's like creating a digital copy of the book that exists in a decentralized network. When you want to share the book with your friend, you simply give them the link to the digital copy, and they can access it directly from their own location. This way, you don't have to physically hand over the book, and your friend can read it without having to travel to your location.

#### ðŸ“– Standard Definition:
IPFS is a decentralized storage system that enables users to store and share files in a peer-to-peer network. Unlike traditional file systems, IPFS doesn't rely on a centralized server to manage file storage and retrieval. Instead, files are broken down into small chunks, and each chunk is stored on multiple nodes in the network. When a user wants to access a file, the network retrieves the necessary chunks from the nodes and reassembles the file. This decentralized approach makes IPFS more resilient to censorship and more efficient for large-scale file sharing.
