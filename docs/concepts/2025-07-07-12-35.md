### ðŸ“˜ Concept: Linea

#### ðŸ§© ELI5 Allegory:
Imagine you're on a hike in the woods, and you're trying to get to a specific waterfall. You're not sure exactly where it is, but you have a rough idea of the direction you need to head. As you walk, you keep a mental "map" of your journey, noting landmarks and features that help guide you towards your goal. This is similar to what Linea does in the context of blockchain. It's a continuous chain of blocks, each containing transactions, that helps guide the network towards its intended purpose.

#### ðŸ“– Standard Definition:
Linea refers to the sequence of blocks that make up the blockchain, with each block containing a hash of the previous block, creating a continuous and unbroken chain. This chain is the backbone of the blockchain, allowing nodes to verify the integrity and validity of the transactions recorded within it. As new blocks are added to the chain, the Linea grows, providing a permanent and immutable record of all transactions that have taken place within the network.
